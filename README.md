## Description

This module can be called by external programs for disk /or tape file I/O operations on sequential files. 
It handles BSAM, and Channel I/O operation.  

## How to build Instructions

1.   Place all assember source parts in the same Partitioned Dataset within a z/OS operating system
2.   Use these options to assemble the GVBUR20 Source 
//ASM      EXEC PGM=ASMA90,                                  
// PARM=(NODECK,OBJECT,'SYSPARM(RELEASE)','OPTABLE(ZS7)',    
// 'PC(GEN),FLAG(NOALIGN),SECTALGN(256),GOFF,LIST(133)')     
3.  Ensure the HLASM Toolkit structured macros are in the SYSLIB concatenation along with the
    the parttitioned dataset you have placed the other assembler parts in this repo.
4.    Use these parameters to bind this part
//LINK     EXEC PGM=IEWL,                                      
// PARM=(XREF,LET,LIST,MAP,AMODE(31),RMODE(ANY),REUS(RENT))
